                    <p>"Thanks so much for your input and your great plan! I never would have been able to conceptualize it for myself, and your greater knowledge of plants is really invaluable. I have learned a lot doing the plant buying and planting myself, and it has been so much fun. Now my "cozy" back area looks great and is really useable instead of being an ugly weed plantation.”</p>
