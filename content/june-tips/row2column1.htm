<h3>Vegetables</h3>
 <p>Finally, danger of frost is almost assuredly past&hellip; so get those crops going! Tomatoes, beans, melons, squash, peppers... these and more are great to plant in June. As always, please reference our <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/veggies/VeggieCalendar.pdf" target="_blank">veggie calendar</a> for planting time recommendations. Remember that most fruiting veggies (like many of those just listed) enjoy fertile, loose soil with lime and fertilizer added.</p>

<p>If you did an early to mid spring crop of greens, they should be harvestable about now. This might be your last good chance for starting another crop of these, as greens can be challenging to grow in the heat of summer. If they &lsquo;bolt&rsquo;, or bloom, the flavor of the leaves turns bitter.</p>

<p>Early planted cole crops (cabbage, broccoli, etc.) may be harvested as soon as ready. It is best to wait to replant these vegetables until late summer or early autumn. Avoid planting them now because summer&rsquo;s heat diminishes them, and you will have a meager harvest. These truly are cool-weather crops.</p>

<p>If the garlic that you started earlier this year or last year starts to flower, break off the stems. Allowing them to develop can drain energy, and therefore harvest, from the bulbs themselves. Try to be a moderate waterer, as inconsistent watering is one of the causes of premature flowering in this case.</p>
