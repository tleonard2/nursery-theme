<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit</h3>

<p>Feed your roses and other summer flowering shrubs. Roses may be showing some fungal problems such as black spot or powdery mildew, so watch for those and treat where appropriate. The first part of June is usually when roses come into bloom, so it can be a great time for viewing or shopping for them.</p>

<p>If the weather has been wet, you may see significant shothole fungus on your cherries, plums, and their relatives. This is a fungus that only spreads when the leaves are moist, but it can spread quickly if June is wet and you do not treat for it. Feel free to inquire about an appropriate fungicide for this or other similar troubles.</p>

<p>It is too early for summer pruning of fruit trees, as truly dry weather is desirable for this. Also, most shrubs should not be pruned now. The only exceptions would be any rhododendrons or their relatives that are just finished flowering. Note that you do not want to wait into summer for this, it should be done promptly after flowering. The reason why is that rhododendrons form next year&rsquo;s flower buds during the current summer/autumn growth season, and we do not want to remove those by pruning.</p>

<p>Apple maggot flies (the adult) become active as temperatures warm, and start laying their eggs on forming fruit. These are one of the types of &ldquo;worm&rdquo; in apples. If you have had such a problem in the past now is the time for hanging traps to monitor for their presence. Note that traps are generally not a remedy by themselves; they are usually accompanied by timely spraying once the pest is detected on the traps.</p>
