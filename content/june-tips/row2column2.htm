<h3>Lawn Care</h3>

<p>You can still start new grass seed in June, but watch the water needs carefully. If it gets hot and dry soon after germination, the grass may fail. Sod is a little easier this time of year, and fights back against the weeds better.</p>

<p>If you have not done so recently, go ahead and feed your lawn. While it is not generally recommended to feed lawn in late July to August, now is still part of the natural growing season for lawn grasses.</p>

<p>Watch for those thistles and dandelions, now that the days are getting warmer they will start breeding all the faster. Dandelions can take dry conditions better than lawn can, so be a consistent waterer. Also, dandelions thrive in calcium depleted soil better than lawn; a good reason to keep up with lime applications.</p>

<p>Crane flies and other grubs are active this time of year and can be the culprit if you have a patchy lawn. If so, dig up a section of it, down to a few inches, and look for any ugly grubs between &frac12; and 2 inches long, white or gray. If so, treatments with insecticides or beneficial nematodes can often help. As always, use any insecticides according to label directions, and make sure to get an appropriate one (we can help you select the best one).</p>
