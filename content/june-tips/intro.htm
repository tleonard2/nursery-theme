<p>June marks the beginning of irrigation season unless May was unusually dry.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/seasonal-tips/august">August Gardening page</a> has some detailed information on good watering techniques, and we encourage you to have a look there. Aside from that, know that June watering can be random; we might get shower after shower followed by a series of dry, hot days. Be ready to water, but do not do so unless the soil/plants are ready for it. Recent plantings always need more water than established plants, so make adjustments as necessary.</p>

<p>Mosquitos can start to be a pest now. Avoid standing water, or change it quite regularly. If that is impractical (ponds, etc.), consider mosquito dunks or another appropriate product to kill the larvae.</p>

<p>June can mean good planting weather. If we have an excessively wet spring, this might be the first time your clay-based soil is actually drying out and becomes easier to dig. It is a fine time for planting almost all types of plants, if you or someone is going to be around to water this summer. You cannot leave a June-planted tree, perennial, or vegetable bed to go without water during the summer that follows.</p>
