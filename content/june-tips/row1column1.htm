<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>Our stock of annuals is at its peak at this point. All warm season annuals should be available, including sunflowers, zinnias, vines, and other heat lovers. Clean out those empty or tired pots and get yourself some color. Note that pansies often start to look pretty bad as the season gets hot, so many gardeners replace them in June with summer bloomers.</p>

<p>Our stock of perennials should be at or near its peak in June. While the earliest bloomers (candytuft, <em>bergenia</em>) may be out of bloom, they may still be available for purchase. Also, the summer bloomers are ready to go home with you; get those <em>crocosmia</em> and daisies now.</p>

<p>Many garden insect pests are problematic in June. Caterpillar damage may begin to get bad, and aphids and slugs may reach significant populations. Thrips and whiteflies may appear on susceptible flowers, and flea beetles and cutworms can be troublesome to vegetables. If you have a pest, try to identify it correctly so that you can make the best decisions about control methods. We can, of course, help with identification and recommend controls, whether they are natural predators, insecticides, or waiting the problem out.</p>

<p>Get those begonias and dahlias planted if you are still hanging on to them. Summer-flowering bulbs should be in the ground now, so plant ASAP if you have not already done so.</p>
