<h3>Lawn Care</h3>

<p>Now is a good time for a first lawn feeding, especially if you are using an organic granular fertilizer. If you prefer a synthetic food, make sure there is a spell of mostly dry weather ahead to avoid runoff, though you do want to irrigate once after application. If you have not done so in the last year, you can apply some horticultural lime.</p>

<p>April is often one of the best times to add more seed to your lawn, but March can work if the weather is fair. This is recommended for thin or patchy lawns. If you have a thick layer of thatch, you can rake it out now. Moss control products can be applied now if you have not done so already. Watch for the first appearance of weeds; everyone that you remove before it flowers is a generation of them that won't be growing later. Note that most herbicides do not work in cool weather, so I am talking about hand weeding.</p>

<h3>Indoor Plants</h3>

<p>Spring is the best time for repotting of houseplants, and it might now be time to pot up any of yours that really need it. Symptoms of needing a bigger pot include drying out more rapidly than usual or just seeming way too big for the pot. Always use fresh potting soil and loosen the root ball if it is wound up. When going up in pot size, only go one to two inches in depth and/or width. Always water your plants after repotting. Keep in mind that overwatering can still be a problem, as the days are often still quite cloudy. This is especially true of any recently up-potted plants. If you have plants that are particularly sensitive to overwatering then wait until later in spring for repotting.</p>
