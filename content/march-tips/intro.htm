<p>Planting season has begun!</p>

<p>Assuming your ground is workable, now is first planting time for most of us. If you have water-logged clay soil you might want to cover it with plastic or wait for a dry spell before digging, but otherwise start getting those hardy plants in the ground. The danger of frost is not past, so it is still time to protect tender plants (those that cannot survive a hard frost). This includes newly planted vegetables and annuals. Note that it is simply too early for truly warm season crops.</p>

<p>If you mulched your garden heavily before winter, you might consider removing part (not all) of it now. A thick layer of mulch can slow soil warming and delay plant growth. If you used compost as your mulch, it can be dug in unless this will significantly disturb root systems of neighboring plants. If you used bark or similar organic matter, it is best to compost it before digging it in. If you did not mulch before winter, this is a good time to add a light layer of compost to your soil. Remember that mulch should not be piled up against the trunk of a tree or shrub.</p>

<p>Slugs and cutworms can cause considerable damage during this time of year, so keep an eye out if you have susceptible crops such as lettuce and other greens. Aphids can seem to appear out of nowhere in March and can start doing damage on many crops and ornamentals. These pests can be controlled with appropriate baits or sprays, just be aware that they breed and spread fast.</p>
