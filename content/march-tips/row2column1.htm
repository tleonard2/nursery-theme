<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p>Feel free to plant out most greens and cole crops (broccoli, cauliflower, etc.) but be ready with frost blanket for any extra cold nights. Many root crops can be planted now, including onions, potatoes, radishes, garlic, and shallots. When planting root crops, be sure the soil has a fair amount of organic matter, and few or no rocks. If you haven't already, peas can be started in March. Waiting too long can reduce the chance that you will get a good crop; peas like it cool. Unfortunately, it is not yet time to be planting most &quot;fruiting&quot; vegetables yet, such as tomatoes, peppers, or squash. Also, skip the basil outside; too early. Sorry. Such plants can be started in heated greenhouses, or possibly in the house.</p>

<p>If you do choose to start seeds in the house to get a jump on summer, March to April is often good timing. Most seed packets will say how many weeks before last frost the crop should be started indoors, so plan accordingly. Last frost timing can vary greatly, with April 15th being about an average, and frost unlikely after May 15th. Here are a few cautions about seed starting indoors. Grow lights can help immensely, but often a bright south or possibly west window will do. Remember that most crops prefer full sun, and they won't be getting it. Also, if the time you were planning on placing the starts outside turns out to be unseasonably cold, you might have to delay the planting (remember any rainy Junes?) and the plants might get very leggy.</p>
