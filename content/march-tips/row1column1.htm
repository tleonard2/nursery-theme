<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>There is plenty of color ready for you now that spring is arriving, though the full selection of summer bloomers are not quite here. <a href="/perennials/viola/">Pansies</a> have been with us all winter and are still great, but now add to the list: <a href="/perennials/bulbs/">blooming bulbs</a>, <a href="/perennials/anemone/">anemones</a>, ranunculus, snapdragons, alyssum, and more. By the end of March we will have <a href="/perennials/geranium/">geraniums</a>, <a href="/perennials/fuchsia/">fuchsias,</a> and other hanging basket plants. As for new perennial availability, look for <a href="/perennials/iberis/">candytuft</a>, rock cress, and creeping phlox; all are in bloom and ready for your garden. The evergreen perennials have been in full swing with good availability on <a href="/perennials/hellebore/">hellebores</a>, <a href="/perennials/heuchera/">coral bells,</a> <a href="/herbs/rosemary/">rosemary,</a> lavender, and more. <a href="/perennials/hellebore/">Hellebores</a> especially steal the show in February and March.</p>

<p>See all that new growth starting to form in your perennial beds? Now is the time to get out the old plant food. If you use granular foods, it is a great time to start regular applications.</p>

<p>If you prefer water-soluble fertilizers, you might consider waiting awhile or at least until periods of somewhat warm and dry weather. March is often an acceptable time for dividing and moving perennials. If you have not done so, remove dead matter on your perennials if you prefer a tidy look. Cut back any ornamental grasses that are dead looking and brown. Do not cut these to the soil line; leave a tuft to ensure better regrowth.</p>

<p>We are fully stocked with bulbs inside the store now, including <a href="/annuals/begonia/">begonias,</a> lilies, <a href="/perennials/dahlia/">dahlias,</a> and many others. Get all those summer bloomers now and grow them yourself. This is significantly less expensive than buying grown plants later in the season.</p>
