<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit</h3>

<p>March marks the beginning of tree and shrub planting season, and we have a great availability. Roses and fruits especially are fully stocked at both of our locations. As the plants flush out their new growth, fertilizing can be started on both recent and older plantings. Roses can be pruned in March if they were not done in February; the sooner the better at this point. If your do not want your pines to get bigger, prune the candles, or new growth off. Hedges can be sheared now if they are overgrown after last year.</p>

<p>Early flowering shrubs can be pruned after the flowers have faded if are just controlling their size. Any pruning of trees should probably have already be done, or delayed until summer in some cases. Start watching for the first signs of infection on new growth of disease-susceptible plants. Once the leaves have formed it is too late to dormant spray, but there are in-season pesticides that can help an emerging problem. It is easier to control a problem as it develops than once it is covering your plant.</p>
