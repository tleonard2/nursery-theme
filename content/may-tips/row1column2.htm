<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit</h3>

 <p>May is a great time for planting woody plants. We have an excellent selection for purchases at this time. The soil is warming and drying a bit, and digging shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard at this point. When preparing the planting site, remember that the soil underneath the root ball should not be loose; it will compact later and the stem will end up buried too far, often killing the plant. This is especially true of balled-and-burlap (B&amp;B) trees that have a clay-based soil in the root ball.</p>

<p>This is also a fine time for feeding your established trees and shrubs if you have not done so recently. Mature trees or large shrubs may not need feeding; judge this on their performance. If they grow and bloom just fine, it probably isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>

<p>Roses are just getting ready for their first blooms of the year. Feed them as well (if you have not recently), and watch for pests. Aphids may have set in, and fungal diseases such as black spot may be starting to grow.</p>

<p>As established hedges start to grow, this may be a good time to trim for size and shape. Lightly feeding them as well can encourage that fresh flush of growth to minimize the time that they look like they were just cut. Of course, this might mean more frequent pruning with fast growers.</p>

<p>Rhododendrons and other spring flowering evergreens can be pruned just after bloom. This may be the only good time of year for mild to moderate pruning of rhodies because pruning late in the year can ruin the flowers for next year.</p>

<p>With most shrubs, the trimming just mentioned is for mild trimming for size and shape. Removal of large branches is often better for the plant if done in winter.</p>
