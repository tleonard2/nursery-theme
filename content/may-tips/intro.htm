<p>It’s time to start thinking about how you want your garden to look this summer, and a big part of that involves figuring out exactly how you’re going to be watering your plants throughout the season. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses are an excellent way to efficiently conserve water while also getting you into the habit of watering more evenly. And while wise water use will lessen your water bill and help your plants thrive, it’s good for the environment and local watershed too. </p>

<p>Here's a list for ways to more efficiently use water in your garden:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mulch</li>

    <li>Water deeply and less frequently, instead of often and shallowly.</li>

    <li>Water early in the day.</li>

    <li>Wherever you can, use soaker hoses or drip irrigation system.</li>

    <li>If you use sprinklers, don't set them so high that they give off a mist, which will just uselessly evaporate away.</li>
</ul>

<p>And speaking of water, if you happen to have a pond or other water feature in your garden, it’s time to start cleaning it up a bit—if you haven't already—and check that your pump is clean and in good working condition. Place mosquito dunks in your pond to keep mosquitos under control. If your pond has water lilies that were sunk for winter protection, it is time to raise them back up closer to the surface and feed with water lily fertilizer tabs (available at the Division Street location).</p>
