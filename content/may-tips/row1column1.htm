<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>Well, it is annual planting season if ever there was one. Impatiens, petunias, salvia, bacopa&hellip; this list of available annuals could get quite long. Delay planting only if it is still unusually cold at night. There are only a few types not ready in May so come on down and get those pots and beds filled.</p>

<p>Ever heard of the thriller, filler, and spiller rule? The basic idea is to get a combination of plants with different growth habits to create a lush and full container display. Go to our <a href="/container-gardens/thriller-filler-spiller">Thriller-Filler-Spiller Page</a>, where you will find a list of example plants from the three categories and also check out our <a href="/container-gardens">Container Designs Page.</a></p>

<p>When planting your annuals, pay attention to the maximum spread and allow each individual a little room to grow. Adding granular time-release fertilizers after planting can help keep the plants fed for the next several weeks, helping to encourage vigorous growth and abundant flowers.</p>

<p>As for perennials, the season started a while back but continues now. Many heat-loving perennials are not available until May such as Echinacea and other daisy-like plants. Now is a great time to get both spring and summer bloomers to fill in those blank spots; it may be our best selection of the year.</p>

<p>As for your existing perennials, tidy and fertilize if you have not already done so this spring. Most perennials should be growing well now and can use the nutrition. Also, adding a thin layer of compost on top of the soil can improve the soil and temporarily suppress weeds. Get those peonies, dahlias, and other floppy growers caged so that the blooms will stand up well later on. It is best to get the cage set before the plant has grown up to the height of the grid or ring; if the plant is already tall be careful to gently tuck the foliage into it. This is probably the last acceptable time for any dividing before the heat of summer.</p>

<p>Now or in June is the best time for planting heat loving tuberous plants such as begonia and dahlia. For those bulbs that are blooming or just finished, go ahead and feed them if you have not yet done so this season. Do not remove green leaves from bulbs even if they are floppy. They usually only last a while and the plants need to be absorbing as much sunlight as possible.</p>

<p>Pests are definitely rearing their ugly little heads. Aphids are spreading rapidly, and uncontrolled slug populations can get large this time of year. These can be controlled with insecticidal sprays or baits, many of which are safe for people and pets if not misused. With aphids, a quick glance at the new growth or blossoms can give them away. Look for the soft bodies of any color and dandruff-like molted skins on or near the new leaves. If you have seen what looks like saliva on rosemary, lavender, and other plants you are seeing spittlebugs. While unsightly, they are usually fairly harmless.</p>

<p>Sometimes people mistake hail damage on leaves for insect damage. Consider that possibility when you see holes in the leaves. We can help to identify such questions/problems, of course.</p>
