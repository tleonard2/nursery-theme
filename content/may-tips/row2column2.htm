<h3>Indoor Plants</h3>

<p>Wash the leaves of indoor plants and check/treat for pests and diseases. If you suspect you have a problem with a plant and are not sure what it is, bring a sample to our Info Desk. We carry a full line of safe products for houseplants and tropicals.</p>

<p>It's time to be feeding most indoor plants, as they actively put on growth. We have several types of indoor plant food, and recommend Whitney Farm's Ellie's liquid as a good all-around fertilizer. Give us a call if you have questions on feeding or care of specific indoor plants.</p>

<p>Start setting houseplants outside in a shady location for some fresh air. If you have any questions about particular plants and where they like to spend their spring and summer, feel free to call either of our locations (for houseplant questions, some members of our Division Street Staff are especially knowledgeable; that location has the broader selection of houseplants and tropicals and therefore the opportunity for more personal experience).</p>
