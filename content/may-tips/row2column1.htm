<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p>May is generally the first month recommended for planting most warm-season vegetables, such as tomatoes and eggplants, but you’ll need to keep them protected until the temps are steadily above 50°F—and that usually happens around mid-June. Some people start their squashes and melons in May, although June is often a better time for them as well.</p>

<p>For those who have already planted but are worried about chilly nights there are products to help a bit. Red plastic mulch around the plant or plastic tubes to be filled with water are sold here, and they can keep the plant a bit warmer.</p>

<p>If you did not do so already, make sure to add some lime to your soil when you plant your fruiting vegetables (tomatoes, squash, peppers, etc). This is especially important for tomatoes and squashes, as it helps to prevent blossom end rot.</p>

<p>If you started seeds indoors or in a greenhouse, it may be warm enough to acclimate them to outside temperatures and plant them, but watch for chilly nights; they will be susceptible to cold damage.</p>

<p>It is not too late for most greens and cole crops (cabbages, broccoli, and their kin), but the sooner the better. If it gets hot early in the growing season they may bolt, ruining the crop.
