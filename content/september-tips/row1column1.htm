<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>Some of your summer annuals may be a bit tired looking or overgrown. In some cases a trim and a bit of water-soluble fertilizer will get you a few more weeks of bloom. Others should probably be discarded in favor of some new fall color. This means those annuals and short-lived perennials that look great now through autumn and often times into winter. Pansies, kale, dusty miller, mums, asters, and black-eyed-susans are all examples of this. There are plenty more flowers to enjoy; the growing season isn&rsquo;t over yet!</p>

<p>As for perennials, the late-season flowers are in full swing and full stock on our shelves; asters, many daisy style plants, yarrow, and salvias are blooming nicely. The beginning to middle of autumn is one of the best times for planting assuming temperatures have cooled since summer. The majority of cold hardy perennials thrive with fall planting since their root systems can grow all winter and emerge in the spring ready to grow.</p>

<p>If you have poorly drained soil you may want to wait until spring to plant perennials that require good drainage such as penstemon and lavender. Once the weather has cooled down, it is also a good time for dividing established perennials, though October is the more common month for that.</p>

<p>Bulbs! It is finally that time again! Tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, alliums, crocus and many others are available for purchase starting in September. While refreshing those flowers beds and containers with some pansies or other fall color, add some spring flowering bulbs in there as an investment in next year&rsquo;s show.</p>

<p>Some bulbs can also be grown in pots, often indoors, during the late autumn and winter. This is generally called forcing. The most common bulbs for this are paperwhites (Narcissus &lsquo;Zeva&rsquo;) and amaryllis. While they can be started as early as September, most people prefer to wait until October for amaryllis or November for paperwhites to try to match the bloom period to the holiday season. Other people start a few more paperwhites every week to extend the season of enjoyment.</p>
