<p>September marks the beginning of the second planting season.</p>

<p>It's true – fall is for planting! The soil’s still warm, and that’ll provide for faster root growth and give plants a bit of a head start. By next summer, they’ll have larger, more established root systems that allow for improved drought tolerance and better growth throughout the first year. </p>

<p>Shorter autumnal days and mild temperatures mean lower stress on new plants, and the inevitable rains help keep those new plants watered-in—which means less work for you (and maybe a few extra days leftover to enjoy the hammock). </p>

<p>Fall is also a great time to shop for hardy plants! We’re always stocking up on conifers, winter-blooming shrubs and Pacific Northwest native plants this time of year. Fall favorites—like pansies, ornamental cabbages and kales, and overwintering vegetables and herbs—are all available here at Portland Nursery.</p>

<p>Some plants are borderline hardy for your area and may be challenged by the extreme cold—and because of that, they should be planted in the spring, and that will allow their roots to develop before freezing temperatures arrive.</p>

<p>In Portland it’s generally safe to plant anything that’s hardy to Zone 7 and below in autumn, but popular Zone 8 plants—like New Zealand flax (<em>Phormium</em>), star jasmine (<em>Trachelospermum jasminoides</em>) or hardy Gardenias—should wait until spring. </p>

<p>If you choose to install Zone 8 hardy plants in fall, you’ll need to develop a plan for protecting them during harsh winter weather events.</p>
