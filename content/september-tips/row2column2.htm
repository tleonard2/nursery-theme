<h3>Lawn Care</h3>

<p>September is the month for renovating that summer-weary lawn. First, dethatch if you have not done so in the last year. This is done by thoroughly raking out the dead matter underneath the growing grass blades. Then, assess how full your lawn really is and make appropriate plans to reseed, overseed (applying seed to an existing but patchy lawn), or install sod.</p>

<p>If your lawn is really patchy or almost nonexistent reseeding is best. Turn the soil and mix in some compost. Level it out and add seed, fertilizer, and lime. Cover the seed with a very thin layer of peat moss or fine compost (no big woody chunks). Keep moist and keep the weeds away; you should have a great lawn before winter.</p>

<p>If you are over-seeding, then skip the bit about turning the soil, but a thin layer of compost on top is beneficial before laying the seed, fertilizer, and lime. If installing sod, turn and amend the soil beforehand, and fertilize and lime after installation.
