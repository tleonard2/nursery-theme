<h3>Vegetables</h3>

<p>September is a good time for starting a fresh round of cool-season and overwintering crops. This includes lettuce, spinach, and other greens, as well as some cole crops such as broccoli and cauliflower. Short season root crops such as radishes can be grown now to harvest before winter, and overwintering roots such as garlic and onions can be planted.</p>

<p>Just as importantly, its harvest time for those warm season crops! Here are some tips on harvesting different groups of vegetables:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Melons</strong> &ndash; Most melons will detach from the vine with pressure from just one finger when ripe. And melons do not continue to ripen off the vine, so be careful not to harvest too early!</li>

    <li><strong>Squash</strong> &ndash; Summer Squash are best harvested while still on the small side, because not only is the flavor better, but if left on the plant a long time it begins seed formation and reduces further fruit set. A Winter Squash is completely mature when the stem is brown and shriveled. But usually our summers don't last long enough for that to occur; to optimize harvest, you can remove the very smallest squash and any new ones from the vine after September 1st, in order to allow the plant to put the remainder of its energy into ripening the larger fruit. Harvest before powdery mildew or a first frost has destroyed the leaves, and wipe the skin with a disinfecting bleach solution. Cure the skins by letting the squash air dry at room temperature for a week or so, then store them at about 55&#176; and low humidity for longest keeping.</li>

    <li><strong>Eggplant</strong> &ndash; Best if picked when slightly immature &ndash; when the fruit has stopped rapidly enlarging, but the skin is still shiny and thin. Fruit set stops a week or two before the autumnal equinox, and this is when all developed fruit should be harvested. Smaller fruit may continue on to ripeness if the early days of October are sufficiently warm.</li>

    <li><strong>Peppers</strong> &ndash; Many varieties of both sweet and hot peppers change color from green to red or yellow as they ripen, and as much as possible this should be used as the guide for harvest for best flavor. For thin-walled varieties of hot chili peppers that are intended for drying, be sure to harvest before frost or the onset of the rainy season to prevent rotting of the fruit. If the fruit has not entirely ripened by this time pull up the entire plant and hang upside down in a cool, dimly lit place. Some of the remaining fruit on the plant will both ripen and dry under these conditions.</li>

    <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> &ndash; Tomatoes are at their peak when they easily detach from the stem with only the slightest tug. But what to do as summer wanes, and you are still facing green globes on the vine? You can boost the ripening of the larger fruit by removing all flowers and the smaller, immature tomatoes, beginning about September 1st (these smallest of fruits won't have time to mature, in any case). An additional method is to start withholding water in late August/early September. This stress will cause the plant to ripen its fruit, thinking that it must hurry to ripen its seeds for reproduction. Watch out for late summer rains, however, which can cause these now more fragile vines to fall apart and become diseased. In the almost inevitable event of some green tomatoes: if they are full size at harvest, many will often ripen in the house (but search out some recipes for green tomatoes, just in case!).</li>
