<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit</h3>

<p>It is definitely planting time for hardy trees and shrubs, and we have plenty to choose from. Come on down for the best selection of the year on most of these plant types, including fruits.</p>

<p>Some deciduous trees show their best leaf color just as they emerge in spring. While many <a href="/trees/acer-palmatum">Japanese maples (<em>Acer palmatum</em> cultivars)</a> are well known for their autumn color, some are absolutely exquisite at first leaf emergence. Katsura (<em>Cercidiphyllum japonica</em>) is another example of this, it being a larger, upright tree. For shrubs, some forms of <em>Spiraea</em> and <em>Sorbaria,</em> have great new leaf color.</p>

<p>For existing plantings, now is a good time to start fertilizing as the growing season is underway. Most trees and shrubs are not picky and will do fine with an all-purpose food, although we have specialty foods for acidic soil lovers (rhododendrons, azaleas, dogwoods, camellias, gardenias, etc.) and for fruit vines and trees. Note that older plantings of large shrubs or trees that are thriving anyway probably don't need to be fertilized.</p>

<p>Little pruning is necessary now, the one big exception being spring flowering shrubs. Evergreens such as rhododendron, <em>Pieris</em>, and <a href="/shrubs/camellia">Camellia</a> can be pruned after flowering is finished if you are trying to control the size of the shrub. Early flowering deciduous shrubs such as flowering currant and forsythia can also be pruned after bloom if you did not do so in winter.</p>

<p>Aphids might be making their first appearance on your roses, or possibly on some of your street trees. You know there is an aphid infestation on the trees if your car is sticky after parking under the tree overnight. Note that this symptom may not occur as early as April, but the aphids might be there. There are effective insecticides available if you feel treatment is necessary, but it might not be on larger, healthy trees. Note that the quality of your rose's flowers will be much higher if you do keep the aphids away.</p>
