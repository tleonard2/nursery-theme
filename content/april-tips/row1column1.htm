<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>At home, many of your perennials may be growing and/or blooming now, so it is time to be tidying, fertilizing, and watching for pests. Most fertilizers marked as &quot;rose and flower food&quot; or &quot;all-purpose plant food&quot; are great for perennials. </p>

<p>Watch out for slugs, cutworms, aphids, and other common pests. You will soon see your first spittlebugs of the year if you grow rosemary but hey, they are mostly harmless. As for the slugs and cutworms, your major symptoms are chunks out of leaves or new shoots cut through. We have treatments for all of these and other garden pests, of course.</p>

<h3>There's some good bugs out there!</h3>

<p>Many insects, fungi, and bacteria can benefit your garden in one way or another. Beneficials come in many shapes and sizes and each help your garden in their own way, including controlling pests and pollinating plants.</p>

<p>Creating a suitable habitat in your garden will attract beneficials, helping you to have a sustainable garden and support native wildlife. When relying on beneficials as a form of pest control you must be patient and tolerant of a few pests in your garden, and some damage to your plants. Without a few pests around your beneficials wonâ€™t have anything to eat!</p>
