<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p>If you have not done so already, get those root crops (like onions and potatoes) planted as soon as possible. Brassicas (broccoli, cauliflower, etc.) can be started and grown outdoors in April, along with lettuce, spinach, and most leafy greens. Still be ready to cover with frost blanket just in case of a late cold snap. If you already have some of these early crops that were previously started indoors, be sure to transition them to a cold frame or unheated room/basement window in preparation for planting outside. Gradual temperature changes are the key here, or else the plants might be stunted or fail due to shock.</p>

<p>I'm afraid it's still too early for tomatoes, peppers, melons, and other warm season crops to be outside. These can be started in a heated greenhouse or possibly indoors at this point if you wish to get a jump on summer. Note that melons and squashes are huge growing vines and don't stay tidy on a windowsill very long. Once you are ready to plant these outside (in May or June), follow the same guideline as above for transitioning them, unless the indoor and outdoor temperatures are about equal.</p>

<p>While you are waiting for the temperatures to warm up, you can add organic matter to your veggie beds. Most vegetable crops do best with a lot of organic matter in the soil; manure-based composts are often recommended. Also, regular fertilizer doses (once the crops are growing) are required for most veggies to maximize harvest. Note that different types of fertilizer work in different ways so the definition of &quot;regular&quot; is best found on the packaging of the product you choose.</p>
