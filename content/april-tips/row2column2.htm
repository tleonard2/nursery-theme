<h3>Lawn Care</h3>

<p>April is certainly a time to get your lawn in order. Get that moss out, fertilize, and start mowing as necessary. Apply lime if you have not recently. Lawn usually starts growing quickly in April, filling in those patchy parts. This process is slowed if you have a lot of moss or thatch, so de-thatching may be necessary. Thatch is that layer of decaying organic matter that builds up at the soil surface, near the growing shoot of the grass blades. It can be removed when too thick by a thorough raking with a lawn rake.</p>

<p>If your lawn is quite patchy, this is an excellent time to add seed to thicken it up. Keep humans and pets off the sprouting lawn as much as possible. Sod can be laid as an alternative if the grass is pretty bad and you want to start fresh. Either way, loosen the top layer of soil with a rake and mix a thin layer of compost in before you seed or sod.</p>

<h3>Indoor Plants</h3>

<p>The first part of spring can be felt indoors too. The days are longer and your houseplants may be starting to grow a little fuller. Now is a good time to go through and determine whether you need to do any repotting for the upcoming growing season. As the days get longer and hotter, pot-bound plants can dry out too fast or grow spindly. Get some fresh potting soil and larger pots (just one size larger in most cases) and prepare to repot those pot-bound plants. Be sure to water after the up-potting. It is also a good time to start fertilizing your houseplants after their winter rest.</p>

<p>If you have conservatory plants (plants that go outside for the summer) you might start grooming them for their transition outside. Citrus and gardenias can often go outside in April if the night temperatures are not freezing, but other plant types should begin a gradual period of acclimating to outdoor temperatures, with most going outside in May at the earliest. This list includes <em>Bougainvillea, Hibiscus</em>, and <em>Mandevilla</em>. Sometimes it is beneficial to prune these plants once they go outside so that the re-growth is thick, full, and sun-tolerant.</p>
