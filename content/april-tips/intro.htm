<p>April is perennial planting time, no doubt about it. A vast selection of spring bloomers are looking great and ready to go, and many of the summer bloomers are poking their heads up and it is a good time to divide and separate perennials.</p>
<p>Many annual flowers are appearing now on our shelves; from cold tolerant pansies and spring flowering bulbs to the first of the summer bloomers. This includes <em><a href="/perennials/fuchsia/">fuchsias</a>, <a href="/perennials/geranium/">geraniums</a>, alyssum</em>, snapdragons, <em>bacopa</em>, and others.</p>
<p>Weather can be quite random in Portland during April. Hail, then sun, then a warm afternoon followed by a frost at night is still possible throughout the month and well into May making it too early to have frost-tender crops out unprotected (basil needs protection). Some of the most cold-sensitive items such as <em>Portulaca</em>, <em>zinnias</em> and late blooming <em>Hibiscus</em> or <em>Zaschneria</em> might need to wait for the warmer temperatures of May to be planted.</p>

p>Ladybugs and beneficial nematodes become available in April once the temperatures are warm enough. Ladybugs are natural predators of aphids, whiteflies, and other sucking insect pests. Nematodes are useful for certain soil-borne pests such as crane fly larvae and root weevils. </p>

<p>If you haven't done so already, clean up those overwintered beds and containers and start planning and planting.  Though rainfall is usually frequent, new plantings should always be watered in after planting; don't assume the rain will do it.</p>
