<p>The <strong>Best Practices</strong> approach, sometimes called <strong>Integrated Pest Management</strong> (IPM) is an environmentally sensitive approach to dealing with garden pests. This approach uses the scientific understanding of pests and diseases to determine if a problem requires treatment, and if so, how to proceed in the safest effective way while taking into account the specific sensitivities of the site.</p>

<p><em>Some factors to consider when choosing a solution to your pest problem:</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>What is the safety of the applicator?</li>

    <li>What is the solution's impact on people and pets (safety and other factors)?</li>

    <li>Is there a potential for runoff and what are the consequences for groundwater?</li>

    <li>Does the solution pose a threat to beneficial insects?</li>

    <li>What is the persistence in the environment (how long does it stick around)?</li>

    <li>What is the best timing of the treatment to mitigate the above factors?</li>
</ul>
