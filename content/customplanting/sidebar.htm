                    <p>"We&rsquo;re putting in the next chunk of our planting plan and I cannot tell you how amazed we are with the selections you made! It&rsquo;s like a puzzle that is coming together slowly, and I&rsquo;m so happy with the work you did. I feel like I&rsquo;m looking out at a little paradise you created with us in mind. When I see folks stop and look, I grin and clutch my coffee mug triumphantly &mdash; and we are now an officially certified wildlife habitat!"</p>

     <h2>Measuring Tips</h2>

     <ol>
         <li>With a tape measure, locate the boundaries of your site and sketch them on paper to create a base map.</li>

         <li>Measure structures and plants you wish to keep, utility boxes, hose spigots, and windows, noting their sill height from the ground.</li>

         <li>Write all measurements and an arrowing pointing north on your base map.</li>

         <li>Mark areas that are particularly soggy, dry, sunny, shady, or have poor soil conditions.</li>

         <li>Indicate views to keep and those to block</li>

     </ol>

 <p>"Thanks so much for your input and your great plan! I never would have been able to conceptualize it for myself, and your greater knowledge of plants is really invaluable. I have learned a lot doing the plant buying and planting myself, and it has been so much fun. Now my "cozy" back area looks great and is really useable instead of being an ugly weed plantation.”</p>
