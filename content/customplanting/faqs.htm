<p><strong>Does Portland Nursery design hardscapes?</strong> </p>
<p>If you are looking for a patio, deck or other hardscape features, you'll need to hire an outside designer/contractor to install those elements first. For larger planting areas, informal paths with permeable surfaces such as cedar chips or gravel/flagstone can be included in the planting plan. But no construction drawings are available.</p>

<p><strong>Does Portland Nursery design container plantings?</strong> </p>
<p>Yes. Have a space that needs to be all containers? We can design the layout, containers and plant combinations, pot them up and deliver them finished. Please contact our designer about your project for details.
</p>
<p>If you are looking for one or a few seasonal containers, please check out our Container of the Month page for ideas and then head into either location. Choose the plants and we can do the potting for a small fee: houseplants, hanging baskets, mixed containers, holiday center pieces, window boxes, bonsai, shrubs and trees in containers.</p>

<p><strong>Can you install and maintain my plantings?</strong> </p>
<p>No. We do offer curbside delivery and are always happy to hand select your plants. We can also share a referral list for area gardeners. It's a very word-of-mouth business, so we also suggest asking neighbors/friends for suggestions.</p>
