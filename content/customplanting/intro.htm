<h3>
    Custom Planting Plans will be accepting new submissions starting on February 19, 2022.
</h3>
<p>
    Get a Portland Nursery designed planting plan to take the guesswork out of plant selection.
</p>
<p>
    We use the measurements, photos, and information that you provide in your questionnaire to create a custom plan after consulting with you on practical and aesthetic direction.
</p>
<p>
    Plans for plant combinations are available for ready-to-plant yards that are not overly sloped and already have the hardscape installed.
</p>
