    It’s officially autumn here at Portland Nursery, and that means the return of regionally grown <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/events/apples-pears">apples and pears</a>, plus a couple of <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/events/fall-contests">seasonal contests</a> to help you start the fall off with a bit of fun. It’s also time for the Second Season planting of trees, shrubs, garlic, bulbs, and cool season annuals. <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/perennials/bulbs/">Visit our Bulb Planting Calendar</a> and <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/trees/planting-tips">Tree Planting Guide</a>, or check out our <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/seasonal-tips/october">October Gardening</a> page to make the most of the season and we hope to see you soon!
