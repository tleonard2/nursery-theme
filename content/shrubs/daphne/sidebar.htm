    Facts: Daphne
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Family:</strong> Thymelaeaceae
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genus:</strong> Daphne&nbsp; DAFF-NEE
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Common:</strong> <em>Daphne</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Origin:</strong> Native to Europe, North Africa, temperate and subtropical Asia
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Small flowers are usually fragrant and come in white, pink, lavender, yellow or chartreuse.&nbsp; Often flowers are produced in small clusters, sometimes grouped in masses along stem tips. Many species are evergreen, a few are deciduous.
</p>
<p>
    Leaves are simple, alternate, dark green to blue-green and sometimes variegated with white or cream. Plants form fleshy fruit that is <u>poisonous</u>, but can be decorative in red, orange, yellow or black.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Size:</strong> <em>Daphne</em> are shrubs ranging in size from only 8” high to 15’ tall in their native habitats.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Culture:</strong> Typically <em>Daphne</em>s prefer much better soil drainage than our Portland clay or clay/rock blends provide. Add mulch yearly (make sure not to pile mulch around the base of the trunk), or plant <em>Daphne</em> in containers for assured success.
</p>
<p>
    Light requirements vary by species, so be sure to check plant tags before deciding on the location. Plants can suffer from over-watering or too much sunshine. Hardiness varies per species.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Diseases:</strong> <em>Daphne</em> is primarily bug free in Portland. Problems come in the form of fungus. Root rot, crown rot, leaf-spotting are all fungal issues brought on by poor cultural conditions.&nbsp; Most of these problems can be avoided if drainage issues are addressed when planting.
