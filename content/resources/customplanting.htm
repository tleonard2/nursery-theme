    Get a Portland Nursery designed planting plan to help take the guesswork out of plant selection.

<p>
    We use measurements and photos that you provide to create a custom plan after consulting with you on practical and aesthetic direction.
</p>
<p>
    Plans are available for ready-to-plant yards that are not overly sloped and already have the hardscape installed. We design plant combinations only, no hardscape design or overly sloped spaces.
</p>
<p>
    Turnaround depends on the season, typically 1-3 weeks from consultation appointment to finished plan.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have a plan, we can further help with pulling plants together for pick-up or local delivery.
