<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit</h3>

<p>We get our supply of roses only once a year. Depending on the weather, they might be available as early as the second half of February. Please call ahead to see if we have the rose varieties that you are looking for.</p>

<p>Now is the correct time for pruning most roses. This includes all shrub-style roses; hybrids teas, floribundas, and grandifloras. Cut roses back to about 18 inches tall, just above a bud facing away from the center of the bush. Remove any small, spindly canes or damaged canes. Note that climbing roses and ramblers are not necessarily pruned in this way; they should be trained to fit the spot you are growing them in, and pruned to maintain the training. Please inquire for more specifics if needed.</p>

<p>It is still an acceptable time to do renovation pruning on your shrubs. This means completely removing major limbs on established shrubs. Only renovate for a good reason, such as the limb is damaged, misplaced, or oversized. Minor sheering of shrubs is usually done after the flowering season so that you can still enjoy this year's blooms, or before growth is likely in the case of hedges.</p>

<p>Some fruit trees can be pruned in February, especially apples and pears. Some gardeners also prune cherries, plums, and peaches (collectively called stone fruits) now. Note that some sources, however, state that summer pruning is best for these. To help prevent the spread of diseases, make clean cuts in dry weather and sterilize your pruners between cuts. This is especially true of stone fruits. Please check with us about the correct way to prune your particular fruit type, as listing all the details for each type of fruit is beyond the scope of this text.</p>

<p>Speaking of fruit, February is when the vast majority of our stock for the year arrives. Late February to spring is when our selection is at its best for all types of fruit. Now can be your only chance to get some of the hard-to-find types.</p>

<p>February is the standard time for dormant spraying. This is defined as spraying your deciduous shrubs and trees that are disease or insect prone to help prevent infections later in the growing season. Dormant sprays will damage leaves, so that is why we use them when the plant is dormant and leafless.</p>

<p>Examples include copper, lime-sulfur (both for fungus), and horticultural paraffinic oils (for certain insects). Do not confuse this with neem oil. Check with us or a reliable source for which spray to use for the problems that infect your plants. Fruit trees, roses, and lilacs are examples of plants that benefit from dormant spraying. It is also a good idea to make sure there are no leaves still clinging to these plants, and to rake and remove leaves before spraying if you did not already do so last autumn.</p>
