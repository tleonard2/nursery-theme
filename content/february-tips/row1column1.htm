<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>There is a lot of fresh, new plant material coming in throughout the month, so get ready to liven up those porch containers and, if your soil is workable, your garden beds as well. <a href="/perennials/primula/">Primroses</a>, <a href="/perennials/cyclamen/"><em>Cyclamen</em></a>, and <em>ranunculus</em> all make their appearances on our shelves now. For those who missed the bulbs in autumn, we have potted crocus, hyacinths, and <a href="/perennials/narcissus/">daffodils</a> to help brighten things up.</p>

<p>The earliest of the perennials are here, including <a href="/perennials/hellebore/"><em>Hellebores</em></a>, <a href="/perennials/heuchera/"><em>Heucheras,</em></a> and <a href="/perennials/iberis/"><em>Iberis spp.</em>: Candytuft</a>. Evergreen herbs and ground covers are readily available as well.</p>

<p>The summer-flowering bulbs arrive inside the store towards the end of February. Begonias, <a href="/perennials/dahlia/"><em>Dahlias</em></a>, lilies, and many others will be available. Buying this way is less expensive than buying grown plants later, and there are many specialty bulbs that won't be available later. Note that it is still too early for starting most of these outside now, but you can store the bulbs for a few weeks until fairer spring weather.</p>
