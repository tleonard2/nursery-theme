<p>The weather in February is usually still quite harsh, and despite the frequent rainfall spells of dry freezing air are still possible.</p>

<p>See our <a href="/garden-projects/winter-prep/">Winter Prep page for tips on keeping your garden safe.</a> Note that the information in our monthly tips and on our care sheets is intended for gardening in the Portland, OR area and may not be accurate for higher elevations or different climates.</p>

<p>Aside from winter protection, this is a great time of year to watch out for weeds. As temperatures slowly rise, more species of weed start growing. It may not sound fun, but weeding now significantly reduces the number of weeds in spring.</p>

<p>Depending on your soil, it may still be too early to plant new hardy plants. Many Portlanders have a base of clay soil, and it is not recommended to disturb it significantly if it is still waterlogged. You probably won't kill the plants if you do plant them, but it can compact the soil more than is desirable.</p>

<p>This is the time of year for purchasing mason bee supplies. Mason bees are small, non-stinging, native bees that are very useful for pollination of early flowering fruit trees. In lower temperatures, they are more useful than honeybees. They do not form a hive, and are not dangerous to people. We sell supplies and even bees themselves to ensure they will be helping in your garden.</p>
