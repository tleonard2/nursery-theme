<h3>
    It's the best time for Fruit Trees, Shrubs &amp; Small Fruits
</h3>
<p>
    Many Portlanders have fully embraced vegetable gardening, but may have overlooked some of the small fruits-shrubs and perennials that can make a great addition to any edible garden.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike most veggie crops, most small fruits will continue to produce for years to come, making them a great investment for the landscape. Local garden centers have the best selection of small fruits in late winter and early spring, so now is the best time to pick a fruit plant of your own.
</p>
<p>
    Most fruit trees require regular pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.

    Our mild Portland climate allows us to grow a large variety of small fruits such as brambles (think raspberries and marionberries), non-native fruits such as seaberries and kiwis, and standards like strawberries, grapes and blueberries..
