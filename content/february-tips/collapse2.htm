<p>Blooming hellebores remind us that spring is right around the corner!</p>

<p>The fact that Hellebores bloom in late winter when everything else looks dead or conspicuously absent makes them the stars of the winter shade border.  They are excellent companions for hostas, woodland flowers, ferns, and other shade-loving plants.</p>
<p> They are also deer resistant and somewhat drought tolerant once established.  Being mostly evergreen, their large textured, dramatic leaves provide structure and color year-round.  Combine all these desirable qualities with overall toughness and you get a stellar perennial worthy of inclusion in every garden.</p>
<p>The <a href="/perennials/hellebore-gold-collection">Gold Collection</a> of Hellebores offers a natural progression of blooms from November through March. Selected by Heuger Trading in Europe, these hellebores make wonderful hostess gifts, and dress up any container or garden bed. Many have been selected for outward facing, cream flowers with accents of green or antique rose.</p>

<p>The <a href="/perennials/hellebore-winter-jewels">Winter Jewels Series</a> covers the whole spectrum of floral color and form: singles, doubles, anemone-flowered, speckled, picoteed, veined, and nearly every color and combination of colors imaginable. No garden should be without at least one.</p>
