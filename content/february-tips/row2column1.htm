<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p>All the new seeds are in good supply, and February is one of the best months for planning and shopping for your new garden. It may not be time to grow tomatoes yet, but this might be your best chance to find them if you prefer to grow from seed. It is time for planting peas; they enjoy the cold. Spinach, kale, and other hardy greens can go out now or soon (weather depending), and lettuce can be done now in a cold frame. Be sure to download our <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/veggies/VeggieCalendar.pdf" title="Vegetable Planting Calendar" target="_blank">Veggie Planting Calendar.</a> Our <a href="/herbs">Vegetable and Herb page</a> can link you to a number of Vegetable Culture Brochures.</p>

<p>Potatoes show up here in mid- to late February and we have a great selection. Some of our types you are very unlikely to find in a grocery store. Asparagus also makes it once-yearly appearance on our shelves now, so get it while you can. These should be planted between late February and late March for best results.</p>
