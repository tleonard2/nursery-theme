<h3>Lawn Care</h3>

<p>It is still just a bit early for renovating your patchy lawn, but proper timing is just around the corner. It is best to wait until March before digging in compost and adding new seed. It is also too early for any herbicides to work well, so continue to weed by hand as necessary.</p>

<p>Usually moss is a bigger problem now than weeds, and if this is true for you then continue treatments with a moss-killer as needed. The only fertilizer recommended this early would be a granular organic lawn food; more soluble types should not be used yet because many of the nutrients will wash away with rainfall.</p>

<h3>Indoor Plants</h3>

<p>Some of your plants may have thinned out over the winter due to lack of natural light, but at least the days are getting longer and the plants will start to recover. Supplemental lighting can always help, but is not necessary for most houseplants.</p>

<p>Continue normal care and be careful not to overwater, especially if you keep your house on the cool side. Repotting and fertilizing should probably be held off a bit longer except where it is obviously necessary.</p>

<p>Cyclamen, orchids, and rex begonias are often available now to liven up your living room, or as a great gift for Valentine's Day. We would be happy to help you select a flowering gift and dress it up with a new pot or wrap so it is gift-ready.</p>
