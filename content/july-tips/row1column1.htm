<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>Most summer blooming annuals are in full swing by now and they should be looking great if nothing is going wrong. Remove the seeds from fuchsias and dead head your petunias to encourage more flowers. Watch for slugs (of course) and caterpillar damage on annuals in general and geranium budworm on geraniums and petunias. This budworm can be identified by the small black frass on the leaves and ruined blossoms. Watch for powdery mildew on zinnias, showing as damaged leaves with a white powdery growth. Other than that, most annuals should be fertilized regularly to keep them growing and blooming and you can always add more throughout the season, we will have plenty.</p>

<p>Some perennials do not come into their best until July. This includes lilies, coreopsis, and most daisy-like plants such as coneflower, goldenrod, and shasta daisies. Hardy geraniums, many <em>salvias,</em> and <em>scabiosa</em> are examples of repeat bloomers that will keep going for a long while. The mallow family plants (hollyhock, hibiscus, and <em>lavateras</em>) are coming into bloom as well. Watch for the fungal hollyhock rust and treat promptly; it is a common disease.</p>

<p>Some of the taller growing perennials may require staking or some other support system as they grow. This includes <em>dahlias, delphiniums, crocosmia,</em> and some other upright spike-style flowers. If you are using a caging system such as a tomato cage or peony support cage it is best to have the cage in place before the plant is large. If you are staking individual stems then simply do so before they grow too tall and heavy to support themselves.</p>

<p>While we may have had some dry weather in June, July is usually the first month you have to do regular irrigating. How your flower beds need water can vary greatly. Recently planted annuals and perennials will probably require quite regular, even frequent watering. If they are side by side with established perennials or shrubs try to avoid excessive soaking of these established plants. If you prefer to irrigate the entire bed then do so thoroughly but only occasionally, giving extra drinks to the recent plantings as they need it. Some fresh mulch on top of the soil can help to conserve water.</p
