<p>As these days get hotter watch (and increase) watering, especially for containers and hanging plants.</p>

<p>Remember with all watering, that deep, thorough watering is still more important than frequency.</p>

<p>Many vines start looking their best in summer including star jasmine, honeysuckle, climbing hydrangea, and passionflower. Regularly trim your established vines to keep them tidy and on their support structures. This can mean removal of some vines if a congested vine needs thinning or it can mean snipping off new growth for vines that are getting too long. For newer vines that are not yet grown in, regular doses of fertilizer can speed the process somewhat. Watch for powdery mildew on akebia and honeysuckle vines, especially if they are somewhat shaded.</p>
