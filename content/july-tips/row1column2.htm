<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit cont'd</h3>

<p>Hebe, rose of Sharon (Hibiscus syriacus), <a href="/shrubs/hydrangea">Hydrangeas,</a> and fragrant <a href="/shrubs/clethra">summersweet (Clethra spp.)</a> start blooming and looking their best in the warm weather. Potentillas and Escallonia keep on blooming and <a href="/shrubs/lagerstroemia">crape myrtle (Lagerstromeia spp.)</a> will be starting to flower now or in August. Most trees are out of bloom by July but some late dogwoods may still be showing color. Evergreen <a href="/trees/magnolia">Magnolias</a> and <a href="/trees/stewartia">Stewartias</a> are warm season bloomers and should be getting started. If you are not familiar with the latter, find a picture of their fabulous Camellia-like blossoms.</p>

<p>Your roses should be in full bloom at this point or re-growing after their first flush of flowers. Unfortunately, this is now the time when black spot and powdery mildew fungi start moving in. Remove diseased leaves, do not moisten leaves, and apply fungicide regularly to keep problems to a minimum.</p>

<p>As stated above in the perennials section, water your new plants regularly but not excessively. Avoid watering truly established shrubs and trees frequently as this can slowly cause overwatering and even plant failure. Occasional deep waterings and water after fertilizer application are generally the only irrigation established woody plants need.</p>

<p>Spider mites may make their first appearance now or in August. They are very small pests that thrive in hot, dry weather. Mites can affect a number of plants including several types of conifers such as arborvitae and spruce, roses, many fruit trees, and cane berries such as raspberries.</p>
