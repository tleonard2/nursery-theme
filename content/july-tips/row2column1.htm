<p>Early cold season crops are coming to the end of their season. Harvest any peas you still have growing and harvest your spring batch of cole crops (broccoli, cabbage, etc.) as soon as they are ready if you have not already. Leafy greens should be harvested if they are near their full size, and new plants can be started by seed in part sun throughout the summer. These can be harvested as baby greens or semi-mature plants during hot weather to prevent bolting. Bolting is the process during which the plant goes to flower and seed and the flavor of the leaves turns bitter.</p>

<p>Late July or August are a good time to start a new round of cole crops for fall to winter harvest, especially Brussels sprouts which need a very long season to be ready. A fresh crop of greens for fall is perfectly doable, and peas often work out in autumn as well. If you are trying to figure out exactly when to start your fall crop, remember that it usually take about 14 days longer from germination to maturity than the spring crop does. To figure this, check the seed packet for 'days to maturity', add 14 days, and subtract from the average last frost date for your last recommended planting date. The average first frost in inner Portland is mid- to late November, but it can happen as early as late October. Outlying areas and higher elevations tend to have an earlier first frost date.</p>

<p>Example: A packet if lettuce seeds says 50 days to maturity. Add the 14 days and subtract from November 15th, and you get September 12th as your last recommended start date, 64 days before November 15th.</p>

<p>Most of your warm season fruiting crops should hopefully be already planted. This refers to tomatoes, peppers, cucurbits (squash, cucumber, etc.), and melons. If you have not done so, you can still plant short season crops such as cherry tomatoes and chili peppers from started plants. Corn can still be started in the first half of July.<br>
Many short season root vegetables can be started now, such as turnips, radishes, and carrots. Some long season root crops may be nearing harvest time, particularly the onions and garlic. See our page on <a href="/veggies/onions">Onion culture</a> and our page on <a href="/veggies/garlic/" target="_blank">Garlic culture</a> for details on when and how to harvest.<br></p>

<p>As for your ripening summer crops, keep watering regularly. Note that this means watering before a plant is dry and dehydrated, it does not mean keeping plants in wet soil. Over- and under-watering are primary contributors to other problems such as fungal attacks and blossom end rot. When you see signs of disease or pest problems take care of them as soon as possible to keep the impact upon your harvest minimal. As always, we can help to diagnose and suggest treatments for plant problems.</p>
