<p>Gardeners in the Pacific Northwest are lucky enough to be able to grow vegetables all winter long. Early planning and planting are essential.</p>

<p><em>Start planting seeds in July for your fall & winter harvest.</em></p>

<p>Often there isnâ€™t space in the garden to plant your seeds in July. You can either set aside space when first planning the garden and seed directly, or you can start seeds indoors to be planted after summer crops are gone. Starting seeds indoors also makes it easier to keep the seedbed moist for germination, which can be difficult outside in July.</p>

<p>If you choose not to direct seed, using starts that you bought or grew allows you to transplant outside four to six weeks later.</p>
