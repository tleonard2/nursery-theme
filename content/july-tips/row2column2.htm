<h3>Fruits</h3>

<p>Some fruit plants are already ripe or close to ripe including strawberries and early raspberries and blueberries. Slugs can be a problem with strawberries so slug baits May through early July can increase your harvest. Other fruits, primarily fruit trees, are well in the ripening phase and some fertilizer can help the plants along if you have not done so recently.</p>

<p>Many fruit trees are subject to a number of fungal leaf-affecting diseases during wet spring weather. It might be a little late for treating such problems; the drier air of summer usually lets the trees put on a fresh flush of new growth. It still pays to know your enemy and we will be happy to diagnose any problems. Some sprays may still be appropriate such as treatment for powdery mildew on apples. More commonly, dormant sprays can be planned for this upcoming winter to prevent re-infections next year.</p>

<h3>Lawn Care</h3>
<p>Most of us are familiar with the basics of summer lawn care; mowing, watering regularly, and fighting those dandelions. Here are a few tips that may help a bit. Do not mow your grass low to the ground. This can stunt the grass while allowing more light to the weeds in amongst your lawn. Mowing at four inches high is generally a good starting point.</p>

<p>The old axiom on watering is one inch per week, watering only once per week. This works great for established lawns, but newly rooting seed or sod may need more frequent applications. Many people have their sprinklers set to engage every day or every other day and this is unnecessary and sometimes even detrimental as the goal is to water deeply to encourage downward root growth. As for those dandelions, we sell tools specifically for pulling them out root and all (well, hopefully all the root).</p>

<p>Also, regular applications of fertilizer and lime on a healthy lawn can help the lawn to simply outcompete some weeds. There are of course herbicides available for those who are not having success fighting weeds in other ways.</p>

<p>While there are many different pests and diseases that can affect lawns, there are no particular ones that are so common as to warrant attention here. If you see symptoms such as dead spots, unusual growth rings, or other strange symptoms feel free to check with us for a correct diagnosis and treatment.</p>
