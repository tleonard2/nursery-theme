<h2>An Edible Landscape</h2>

<p>Do you wish for the kind of yard that provides something to eat around every corner? If so, you are not alone. Edible landscaping is on the rise and Portland Nursery is the place to find everything you need to make your dream a reality.</p>

<h3>Berry Big Plans</h3>

<p>We carry a huge selection of berries and small fruits that changes every year, so we post lists annually to help with planning. The lists are based on orders that are confirmed by our growers, so they reflect our best estimate of what to expect. However, we don't always receive what is confirmed - there are often changes in root stocks and crop failures can occur. Only after orders arrive are we certain of our stock.Â </p>

<p>Fruiting trees, berries and small fruits begin to arrive in February, and trickle in weekly through winter. </p>

<p>We plant all of our berries and small fruits in pots, and do not offer bare-root fruits. </p>

<p>We publish our buyers list of small fruits and nut trees in early spring.</p>
