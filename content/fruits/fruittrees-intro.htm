    Do you envision yourself strolling out to the yard to harvest fresh fruit for tonight’s salad or canning giant batches of apple sauce made from apples you grew yourself?
</p>
<p>
    Portland’s mild climate allows for many kinds of fruit and nut trees to be grown. Apples, Figs, Plums and Hazelnuts are just a few of the trees Portland Nursery offers every spring.

    Orchard Planning
</h3>
<p>
    Our selection of fruit trees changes every year, so we post lists annually to help with planning. The lists are based on orders that are confirmed by our growers, so they reflect our best estimate of what to expect. However, we don't always receive what is confirmed - there are often changes in root stocks and crop failures can occur. Only after orders arrive are we certain of our stock.
</p>
<p>
    Fruit trees, berries and small fruits begin to arrive in February, and trickle in weekly through winter.
</p>
<p>
    We plant all of our fruit trees in pots, and do not offer bare-root fruit trees.
