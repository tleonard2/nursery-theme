<p>It is important to water your containerized plants before and during sub-zero temperatures when the air is dry and the wind is blowing.</p>

<p>Please see our <a href="/garden-projects/winter-prep">Winter Prep page</a> for detailed information about protecting your garden from cold damage. For most of us, January is mostly about staying warm and planning ahead, but there are little things you can be doing to protect your plants, and any weeding you can do now means a lot less work later on.</p>

<p>Did you have a cut Christmas tree this year? Don't leave it in the house too long, it becomes a fire hazard. Living (potted) Christmas trees should not be in the house longer than one week. In other words, by January the tree really needs to be back outside. Please see our <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/trees/HolidayTrees.pdf" target="_blank">brochure on living trees</a> for details to ensure your tree thrives.</p>

<p>Many species of birds overwinter in the Portland area, including some hummingbirds. Continuing to provide seed, suet, and nectar helps to keep populations healthy, and back door bird-watching is fun. When the temperature drops well below freezing, regularly placing plastic containers of water outside provides drinking water for them.</p>

  <p>January is not an especially good season for planting new plants or disturbing the soil, particularly if your soil is primarily clay like most of us in Portland. It is likely that your soil is water-logged or frozen. Disturbing clay-based soil in these conditions often compacts the soil, making it harder for the plants in the long run. You probably won't kill a hardy plant if you plant it now, but it is better to wait a while.</p>
