<h3>Indoor Plants</h3>

<p>Even though your indoor plants are heated and not fully dormant, they often slow in growth rate and thin out in winter because of the lack of natural light. Grow lights can help of course, but most houseplants don't require them. Tropical plants that prefer direct sun such as Gardenia, Citrus, and Bougainvillea get quite sparse in winter if they are simply in an average living room. See our guides for overwintering these plants in the <a href="/resources/brochures">houseplant section of our brochures page</a>.</p>

<p>In general, do not fertilize in winter and be careful to water moderately. This means allow plants to partly or even mostly dry out, but water before the soil is fully dry. It is more common for people to overwater plants in winter than to let them get too dry. Repotting should be put off until spring, especially for dry-loving plants such as cacti or succulents.</p>

<p>Often people acquire winter blooming plants over the holidays, and some of these can turn into permanent houseplants. Christmas cacti can live for many years for most gardeners, and are not too hard to rebloom in future years. Despite the fact that they are cacti, they cannot handle extended periods of dry soil and should be moderately watered like most houseplants. Poinsettias often fail after serving their purpose for d&eacute;cor, but if you have treated yours well it may be able to continue to thrive and rebloom next year. Both poinsettias and Christmas cacti require a long night cycle in autumn to early winter in order to rebloom, so remember that for your future plans for them. Note that indoor lighting in your living room or bedroom can disrupt this cycle. Paperwhites should generally be discarded after flowering.</p>
