<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>Flowering primroses have arrived and have joined the pansies as great options for winter color. We will continue to carry pansies throughout winter and spring, and many more plants will be available soon enough. <a href="/perennials/hellebore">Hellebores</a> have just started blooming and definitely add a touch of class to your outdoor spaces. If you haven't seen hellebores at their best, do so soon; you will be impressed. If you have existing hellebores in the ground, some of the leaves might be damaged by freezing weather. These should be removed; they aren't helping the plant and may be hiding the beautiful flowers.<p>

<p>Any bulbs that were set aside in the autumn for forcing indoors can be starte now if they have had two to three months of chilling. <a href="/perennials/tulip">Tulips</a>, <a href="/perennials/narcissus">Narcissus</a>, and hyacinths are all good plants for this. Plant them in fresh potting soil and grow them indoors in bright windows, keeping the soil evenly moist. They will be blooming soon, and you can enjoy a little 'spring color' indoors before spring itself arrives. Once the bulbs are done blooming and spring arrives plant the forced bulbs in the earth, sometimes they will naturalize and come back the following year.</p>
