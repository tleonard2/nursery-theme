<p>Winter is a resting period for most plants. Nights are longer and your indoor plants know it, too. They have far less need for food and water and so you should cut back on both of them accordingly.</p>
<p>Their main growing season is March through September. That is when houseplants want to be fertilized and will take more water. However, gift plants received in winter that are still blooming can use a light fertilizing to maintain and extend the bloom time.</p>
<p>There are always exceptions, of course -- if you have any questions about your particular indoor plant, give us a call or stop by the information desk!</p>
