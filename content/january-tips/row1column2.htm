<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit cont'd</h3>

<p>all bloom this early, and <a href="/shrubs/daphne/">winter daphne (<em>Daphne odora</em>)</a> and wintersweet (<em>Chimonanthus spp</em>.) may be starting. It's quite pleasant to have colorful shrubs in the middle of winter, but here's the best part: many of these flowers smell amazing. Some of the best scents in the world are to be found in the winter garden.</p>

<p>Little care needs to be given to permanent plantings in the ground, except possibly some protection from hard freezes for broadleaved evergreens or half-hardy plants. See the care sheet hyperlinked above for details.</p>

<p>Many ornamental deciduous trees handle pruning best in winter, so if any is necessary this might be an acceptable time. It is still a bit early to be pruning most fruit trees. Most shrubs should be pruned after blooming, so winter pruning is usually not recommended. The exception is any branches that you need to completely remove to renovate the plant. Only do this for a good reason, such as the branches are damaged or unacceptably placed. Most conifers do best with little or no pruning, but any moderate to major cuts you need to make should be done in late autumn to midwinter to minimize sap loss. Minor shearing of hedge or topiary plants can be done now, but they will look better if you wait until spring when they will flush back out quickly. Feel free to check with us as to proper timing for your particular plants. If you are pruning branches off of early flowering plants such as cherry or forsythia, understand that you will have fewer blossoms on your plant in spring. The good news is that you can take some of the smaller cut branches inside and put them in a vase; the blooms will open up in your home for some early color to enjoy.</p>

<p>Dormant spraying can be done in January if you can find a dry day, though a lot of gardeners wait until january. Dormant spraying is defined as spraying your deciduous shrubs and trees that are disease or insect prone to help prevent infections later in the growing season. Dormant sprays will damage leaves, so that is why we use them when the plant is dormant and leafless. Examples include copper sulfate, lime-sulfur (both for fungus), and horticultural paraffinic oils (for certain insects). Do not confuse this with neem oil. Check with us or a reliable source for which spray to use for the problems that infect your plants. <strong>Fruit trees, roses, and lilacs</strong> are examples of plants that benefit from dormant spraying. It is also a good idea to make sure there are no leaves still clinging to these plants, and to rake and remove leaves before spraying if you did not in autumn.</p>

 <p>What snow or ice we get often comes in January, and upright conifers such as arborvitae and cypress can take damage and lose branches in harsh weather. It is a good idea to wrap such plants with twine for a few weeks, binding the branches together so they can support each other. This can minimize any damage to the plants.</p>
