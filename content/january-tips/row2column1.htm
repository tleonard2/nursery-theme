<h3>Vegetables</h3>

<p>It is too early for starting seeds for a vegetable garden, but our new stock of seeds arrives now and our selection is at its best. Your existing kale and other winter greens growing outside or in a cold frame need to be protected from severe dips in temperature with frost blanket. If we are expecting a severe storm, you might just consider harvesting the rest of your greens and eat fresh salads while you are snowed in.</p>
<h3>Lawn Care</h3>

<p>There is little to be done for lawn in the heart of winter. Wait for fairer weather for any seeding or renovation. Moss can be a problem throughout the winter, and applications of moss control products can help to slow the spread. Be sure that the product you select is labeled for lawns, as some moss control products can hurt lawn and other plants. Also, heavy rains following application will simply wash the product away, so time your spray appropriately.</p>
