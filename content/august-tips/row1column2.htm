<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit</h3>

<p>Hopefully the fruit and flowering trees are recovering from any fungal problems they suffered from in the spring. Summer fertilizing can help to replace lost leaves; August is the last month it is generally recommended. Continued applications of fungicide are usually not needed as the fungi usually spread much slower in the dry summer air. Aphids can be a significant issue on larger trees, particularly maples and birches. Ever seen a tree 'dripping sap' in unreasonable amounts in summer? That is usually an aphid sign, not sap.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is appropriate to do some pruning of certain fruit trees in August, especially water sprout removal. These are the very vertical growths, frequent on apples, which shoot up after the fruit has started setting in spring. They are usually not desirable as future branches and can be removed. Major pruning can sometimes be done but is usually put off until winter. Note that some authorities recommend any major pruning or cherries and plums be done in summer, as some diseases can otherwise be an issue. Feel free to inquire about your tree's particular needs.</p>

<p>Roses and other repeat blooming shrubs can benefit from continued fertilizing if you have not done so recently. As most rose growers know, they usually benefit from continued use of fungicide to keep that black spot and mildew in check as well. Hey, nobody said they were the lowest maintenance shrubs (well, we didn't). Deadheading repeat bloomers sometimes makes for better or at least tidier reblooming. Examples of repeat bloomers include <em>hebe, escallonia, cistus</em>, and <em>potentilla.</em></p>
