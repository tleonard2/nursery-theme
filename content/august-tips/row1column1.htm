<h3>Perennials and Annuals</h3>

<p>Most healthy annuals should be looking as good as they are going to get now. We usually have somewhat larger, developed annuals available in August in case you need that quick spruce up before a party or event. Dahlias especially are looking great about now. Continue to water and fertilize your garden as necessary. Pinch back petunias if they get leggy and regrow them. Many of the same issues that occur in July can continue throughout summer so please see our July tips page for information that is still relevant.</p>

<p>Heat loving perennials are at their best now. Most daisy-style flowers are available or are looking great in the garden. This includes asters, shasta daisies, and coneflowers. If you are adding new plants keep in mind that they will probably need small supplemental waterings in addition to what you are giving your garden beds in general. Continue to treat for hollyhock rust on your mallow family plants as necessary. Late August and into September is a great time to get a new ground cover started, whether in a recently cleared area or as a lawn replacement. As with any new planting, make sure it is kept moist until autumn rains set in.</p>
