<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p>August means two things for vegetable gardeners; first, the beginning of harvest season for your summer crops! Early ripening tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers are starting to produce. The first of the garden beans are probably ready as well. There is an excellent guide to harvesting on our September tips page and I recommend you check it out for tips and details.</p>

<p>Second, August is a great time for starting fall batches of many cole crops and, in later August, greens and a new batch of peas. Cole crops include broccoli, cabbages, Brussels sprouts, etc. Short season root crops such as radishes and scallions can be started now, as well. Does it seem odd to be planting in the heat? Well, it will cool off soon enough so get those plants growing. As always, check our vegetable calendar for timing details. See all our <a href="/veggies">culture information on our Vegetable Page.</a></p>

<p>Tomatoes giving you a headache? Well, some crops are more challenging than others. Tomatoes are subject to a number of problems as they develop. Consistent, moderate watering is probably the most important thing to preventing these from ruining your harvest. This means letting the soil partially but never completely dry between waterings. Other than that, watch for leaf spotting symptoms that can indicate late blight or other diseases. Once identified, these can usually be treated to still ensure harvest. Sometimes thinning the leaves and thickly grown plants can allow better sun penetration and air circulation, lessening disease pressure. Sometimes appropriate sprays can help; be sure to get a proper diagnosis first. Blossom end rot is when the bottom end of the tomato turns mushy and brown. This is caused by inconsistent soil moisture (yes, poor watering), wide temperature fluctuations, and/or a lack of calcium. The best way to ensure the presence of calcium is to add lime before you start your vegetables; yes, it is too late to do this now.</p>

<p>Your cucurbits (squash, cucumbers, etc.) are likely showing some powdery mildew by now. This is pretty normal. It is shown as a powdery white substance on the top of the leaf that rubs off to reveal some damage to the leaf. Ensure maximum sun and air circulation, and you can use fungicides to treat as you see fit.</p>
