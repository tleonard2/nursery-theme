<p>The <strong>main growing season</strong> for all plants is March through September. Daylight hours are longer and plants respond by pushing new growth. This is the time to increase watering and to start fertilizing. There are many types of fertilizers to choose from, but you will want to base your decision first on what state the plant is in.</p>

<p><strong>If your plant is a flowering one,</strong> say an orchid, you would want to use a fertilizer for &lsquo;flowering&rsquo;. Conversely, if your plant is not a flowering one, but rather a &lsquo;foliage&rsquo; plant, you would want to choose a fertilizer with a profile for leaf growth.</p>

<p>Your decision to choose organic fertilizer or not is more about your personal preference as the plant does not know the difference. Do be careful with over fertilizing in that salts and minerals can build up in the soil causing problems later.</p>

<p>With more daylight hours, your houseplants respond by <strong>increasing their photosynthesis.</strong> This production of food puts more demand on the plants need for water, which you can monitor by actually touching the soil. Stick your finger in the soil along the side of the pot and feel the soil. Is it bone dry or still damp? This is a better method than a weekly watering program since so many variables occur in your home. A hot sunny window next to an air vent will dry a plant faster than a window with only morning light and still air.</p>

<p><strong>Houseplants can thrive outside during this time of year.</strong> This is a great opportunity to lightly hose off dust and generally give plants a break form being cooped up all winter long. Do use caution when moving your plants outside as they will need to be slowly transitioned; the change from inside to outside can shock a plant.</p>

<p>The night time temps need to be mild-warm; <strong>watch the daylight as sunlight can be too strong</strong> and burn plants that would otherwise be sheltered and insects can find their way to your plant. Always know the requirements of the plants before moving them outside and check them closely before bringing them back inside for hitchhikers (insects that can travel indoors with the plant).</p>

<p>There are always exceptions and each plant has its own needs and requirements. Knowing what type of plant you have is of course the first requirement in knowing how to care for your houseplant.</p>
