 <p>We are wild about roses! There’s nothing quite like stuffing one’s nose into a big dewy rose bloom and taking a long sniff! That’s why we always offer a huge selection of traditional favorites and new additions every spring.</p>

<p>Our bare root roses arrive in February, and our potting crews get right to work planting them in containers. All are sold in pots, rather than bare-root, which protects their roots from breaking and drying out. Rose flowers are hard to resist, so when they bloom, our selection fades. Please call in advance to find current availability.</p>

<p>You can find our best selection of roses in March and early April when our potting process is complete.</p>

<p>Our rose buyer carefully selects the best varieties based on color, fragrance, and disease resistance. You'll find all the roses we plan to bring in this spring in our handy Rose Lists.</p>
