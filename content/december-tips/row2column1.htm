<h3>Lawn Care</h3>

<p>Remove leaves from the lawn. If you are using your leaves as mulch in garden beds, it might be beneficial to shred them with the lawn mower before raking. The smaller pieces turn to compost more quickly, improving the soil in the spring. It is too late to fertilize your lawn effectively, and it is not a good time to seed, de-thatch, or aerate.</p>

<p>Moss is probably starting to encroach. You can use a moss control product, but moss will probably still grow back over the rest of winter. If you do, make sure the product you use is labeled for lawns; some moss control products can damage or kill your lawn. We sell some of the products useful for this. If your lawn has very bald patches, you might want to consider mulching the patches until spring to prevent weeds, and reseed then.</p>
