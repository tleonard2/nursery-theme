<h3>Vegetables</h3>

<p>The only green vegetable that should be planted this late is kale. Existing cole crops (broccoli, cabbage, etc.) and lettuce or other greens can be protected with frost blanket or in a cold frame. If possible, harvest what you can before a hard freeze (significantly below freezing) and enjoy. Last chance for autumn planting of garlic and onions for harvesting next year.</p><h2>Vegetables</h2>

<p>Few vegetables should be planted in December, though kale may be an option. If you are working under glass or in a cold frame, other cold tolerant greens might work as well. Overwintering garlic and onions should have probably already been planted, but think of this as the last chance to get them in. The same goes for spring flowering bulbs: last chance to plant.</p>

<p>Slugs can persist throughout the winter, so keep an eye out if you are growing susceptible winter annuals or vegetables such as lettuce or primroses. Slug baits can still be used, though they might wash away in winter rains. Many weeds continue to grow in winter, and any weed you pull now will be many less in spring.</p>
