<h3>Trees, Shrubs and Fruit</h3>

<p>If you have nice evergreen trees or holly, you might be tempted to take some clippings for holiday decorating. That is fine, but pay some attention to how the plants will look after you make the cuts. With conifers, do not cut back into hard wood, or the plant may not be able to re-sprout from under where you cut. Also, do not remove the central leader of a small tree. We offer many cut greens for sale to round out your selection of greens.</p>

<p>We carry a great selection of living trees at both locations. If you choose to decorate with a living tree, it is recommended to have your tree indoors for no longer than one week. Of course, you can have a decorated tree on the porch for the whole holiday season. For other holiday color, look for the outstanding <a href="/shrubs/callicarpa/"><em>Callicarpa:</em> Beautyberry</a>, <em>Ilex:</em> hollies, or the <a href="/shrubs/cornus-redtwig/"><em>Cornus spp.</em>: Red twig dogwoods.</a></p>

<p>Many deciduous trees prefer pruning be done during late autumn to early winter. Some examples are <em>Acer spp.:</em> maple, <em>Betula spp.:</em> birch, <em>Carpinus spp.:</em> hornbeam, <em>Fagus spp.:</em> beech, and <em>Salix spp.:</em> willow. Other trees take pruning anytime in winter, such as <a href="/trees/styrax/"><em>Styrax spp.:</em> Snowbell</a> , <a href="/shrubs/lagerstroemia/"><em>Lagerstroemia spp.:</em> Crape Myrtlr</a>, and <em>Cornus spp.:</em> dogwood.</p>

<p>Most fruit trees should not be pruned yet. If you have to make any major cuts on your shrubs (renovation pruning), it can be done in winter, but most shrub pruning is recommended for other seasons. Most deciduous shrubs can be pruned now, but if they are spring flowering you might want to wait until after they bloom. This is an acceptable time to prune grape vines.</p>
