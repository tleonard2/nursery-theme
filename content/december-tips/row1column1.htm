<p>Pansies, ornamental kale and cabbages, dusty miller, and some evergreen perennials and grasses can all help to brighten up containers on the porch or entryway, or can be planted in ground if your soil is workable. This means that the soil is not waterlogged or frozen. With our infrequent snowfall, there is no reason you shouldn't be able to enjoy a little color in winter. Pansies usually can take a pretty hard freeze, and be right back in flower within a few weeks. Note that most garden annuals cannot be used now, and many perennials are dormant.</p>
<p>It might be a little late for any division or moving of in-ground perennials, unless your soil is workable. At this point, the sooner the better unless you wish to put the task off until spring. Dead annuals and frozen perennials can be cleaned up if you have not done so to make the garden a little tidier. As a possible alternative, stop to think about which of your plants might have seed or fibers still on them that would be good food or nesting for birds. Such plants you might consider leaving in place.</p>

<p>Empty garden beds can be mulched with leaves, straw, compost, or bark if this has not already been done. If your mixed beds contain trees or shrubs, do not pile mulch around the wooden trunks. Keep in mind that compost will improve to quality of soil, while bark and leaves are better for weed control.</p>
