<p>It's already December!</p>

<p>Come December, if you have pottery that you won't be using for winter, it is usually a good idea to empty them and store them where they will either be dry or free of frost. Terra cotta is especially prone to breaking when frozen. Also, bird baths can freeze and take damage if made of clay or stone. That said, birds still need water when the air is below freezing, so you might consider some temporary plastic containers be placed out if you are emptying your clay bird baths. Autumn to early winter is a good season to start a regular winter feeding schedule for your birds with seed or suet.</p>

<p>When the weather is very cold and dry, your plants are more likely to suffer damage than in wet conditions or when snow covered. If cold, dry air is expected, water your plants beforehand. Make sure that you do not create puddles where someone might slip on an ice slick. Drain hoses and watering cans before a freeze. Consider having some burlap, bubble wrap, and/or frost blanket on hand for additional temporary protection during freezing conditions. In most cases, any wrap on plants should be temporary; do not leave it on all winter. Also, placing potted plants in semi-protected areas (up against the house, out of heavy wind) can give them a little help in winter.</p>

<p>It is not advisable to dig or disturb the earth when it is either saturated or frozen. Mulch any unused areas until conditions are more favorable for planting or digging.</p>

<p>Most of the leaves have fallen off of deciduous trees by mid-December, so it might be a good time for gutter cleaning, and watch for too much moss on the roof or walkways. We sell moss killing sprays for roofs, which can make the physical removal easier. To remove, use a long handled bristle scrub brush and scrape only down the slope of the roof. Scraping up can damage the bond between shingles. Always take precautions when working with roofs; moss and especially algae can be slippery and you are probably rather high in the air.</p>
